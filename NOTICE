Authorship & Override Notice

This repository contains governance doctrine, controls, and documentation
authored by Frederick Redditt under the Millings Layering Method™
(1979–2025 Federal Anchor Chain).

Automation may assist execution; authorship, authority, and accountability
remain human-governed. No content in this repository may be represented as
autonomous, self-authoring, or self-governing intelligence.

This repository is provided for public governance, compliance, and transparency
purposes only. It does not include proprietary enforcement logic, numeric
authority thresholds, notarized artifacts, internal audit logs, or
implementation secrets.

The canonical source of truth for authoritative, notarized records remains
outside this repository.
